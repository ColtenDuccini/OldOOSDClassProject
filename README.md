# Old OOSD Class Project
An old school project built with Scala for the fall 2012 Object-Oriented Software Development course (22c:022) at the University of Iowa.

Code by Colten Duccini and Tingtingao. Some code based on sample code by Cesare Tinelli. 

I have unfortunately forgotten the precise method used to compile the project.
